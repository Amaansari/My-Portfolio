# Modern Portfolio

This is a modern portfolio website built with React, Vite, Framer Motion for animations and Tailwind CSS for styling.


This project uses the following technologies:

* React for building the UI components
* Vite for building and serving the application
* Framer Motion for animations
* Tailwind CSS for styling

The project also includes some basic ESLint rules to help keep the code clean and organized.

This project is a work in progress, and I will be adding more content and features in the future. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know!
